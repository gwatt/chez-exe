ChezScheme Self-Hosting Executable

The goal of this project is to produce standalone executables that are
a complete ChezScheme system and contain a scheme program.
This works by embedding the ChezScheme bootfiles and a scheme program
into the executable.

BUILDING

You must download and build ChezScheme (https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme)
before you can build this project. Once you have done that, you can build
chez-exe by invoking make like so:

  make csdir=/path/to/ChezScheme m=$machinetype

machinetype must match the machine-type specifier ChezScheme provides.

Once built, there two important files: compile-chez-program and chez.a

chez.a is a static library that contains embed_target.o and the kernel.o
from the ChezScheme tree.
compile-chez-program is a program that will take a scheme program and produce
an executable that will run the given scheme program. It uses ChezScheme's
compile-whole-program to generate a single compiled file that contains the
given program as well as all reachable source libraries. Any scheme files
accessed with (load ...) or not available in source form will need to be
distributed with the generated executalble.

You may give extra arguments to be passed to the C compiler. For example:
    compile-chez-program foo.ss -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW
will also link to the OpenGL library, allowing the scheme source to access
the shared libraries by calling (load-shared-object #f) instead of loading
each object individually.
